# Mapping-covid19
Basic mapping principles for COVID-19 data from NYTIMES

The New York Times provides daily (or more frequent) updated data about COVID-19 cases at https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data. There 
is both state and county level data. The R Markdown files here discuss approches to discritize the data and plot both static maps using ggplot and somewhat interactive webmaps 
created using the Leaflet and OpenLayers libraries. The main motivation is to discuss some elementary principles of 'objective' map 
making with the plotting functionalities of R. 

I will add more material realted to bivariate and multivariate maps sometime soon.
