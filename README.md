# Mapping COVID-19
Basic mapping principles for COVID-19 data from NYTIMES

The New York Times provides state and county level data about COVID-19 cases at https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data. The R Markdown files here discuss approches to discritize the data and plot both static maps using ggplot and somewhat interactive webmaps 
created using the Leaflet and OpenLayers libraries. The main motivation is to discuss some elementary principles of 'objective' map 
making with the plotting functionalities of R in the context of COVID-19 data. Accompanying slides provide some conceptual background. As we saw in the workshop, if you want to have a pop-up showing temporal profile of COVID cases for each state (or county), resize your image (make thumbnails) so that they are easy to display. 

I will add more material realted to bivariate and multivariate maps sometime soon.
